## Overview

Tiko_Sasa is built with React and utilizes React Router for seamless navigation between pages. The app features protected routes that only allow authenticated users to access content beyond the home page. Whether you're checking out events, hotels, movies, or contacting us, every page is gated behind a simple login process to ensure your data is secure.

## Features

- **Client-side Routing:** Smooth navigation using React Router.
- **Authentication Protection:** Users must log in to access protected content.
- **Public vs. Private Routes:** Home, login, and registration pages are only for guests, while events, hotels, movies, checkout, and contact pages are locked behind authentication.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure the app looks fresh on every device.
- **Netlify-Ready:** With proper redirection settings for client-side routing, deployment on Netlify is a breeze.
